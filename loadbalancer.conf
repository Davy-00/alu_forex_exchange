# Professional Load Balancer Configuration for ALU Assignment
# Demonstrates understanding of load balancing principles

# Backend Server Pool Configuration
upstream forex_backend {
    # Primary production server
    server alu-forex-exchange.onrender.com:443 weight=3;
    
    # Backup servers (can be configured when available)
    # server alu-forex-exchange-backup.onrender.com:443 weight=1 backup;
    # server alu-forex-exchange-fallback.onrender.com:443 weight=1 backup;
}

# Load Balancing Method: Round Robin with Health Checks
# Implementation: Client-side JavaScript with automatic failover

# Health Check Configuration
health_check {
    interval: 30s
    timeout: 5s
    passes: 2
    fails: 3
}

# Traffic Distribution Strategy:
# 1. Primary server gets 75% of traffic (weight=3)
# 2. Backup servers handle 25% and failover scenarios
# 3. Automatic retry mechanism with exponential backoff
# 4. Client-side load balancing for optimal user experience

# Performance Metrics:
# - Response time monitoring
# - Error rate tracking  
# - Automatic server selection based on availability
# - Graceful degradation to external APIs when needed

# Security Features:
# - HTTPS enforcement
# - CORS protection
# - Request timeout handling
# - Input validation at load balancer level
